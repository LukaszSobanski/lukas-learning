<b>James Ashley</b>  <br> was killed in a police raid in the English town of St Leonards-on-Sea, East Sussex, on 15 January 1998. 
An inquiry found that using armed officers breached guidelines, the raid team was inadequately trained, and officers 
in charge <input type="text"> misrepresented intelligence to gain raid authorisation. A second inquiry accused chief officers of colluding 
to obstruct the first inquiry. The officer who shot Ashley was charged with murder but acquitted on 
the grounds of self-defence. 
<p> The officers who led the operation, charged with misconduct in public office, were also acquitted.</p> 
Ashley's family sued the police for negligence and battery; the case was heard by 
<p>the House of Lords who ruled that the threshold for pleading self-defence in a civil 
    case was higher than in a criminal one and that the litigants should decide which causes 
    of action to pursue. Ashley's death was considered in a report that recommended stronger control 
    of armed operations and equipping officers with non-lethal alternatives</p>
